Dr. Linying Zhang is an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the [Institute for Informatics, Data Science and Biostatistics](https://i2db.wustl.edu) at [Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://medicine.wustl.edu). She leads the `CausAI Lab`, which advances methods at the intersection of `causality` and `machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)` to enhance the explainability, generalizability, and fairness of models trained on electronic health records (EHRs), with applications in real-world evidence generation and clinical risk prediction.

## Lab mission
ML/AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare if developed and deployed thoughtfully. In healthcare, AI models are frequently trained on real-world data (RWD), which are inherently imperfect -- frequently missing not at random, irregularly sampled, subject to measurement error, and reflective of existing health disparities. To realize AIâ€™s promise, it is essential to design methodologies that correct these biases and limitations.

The CausAI Lab is dedicated to tackling these challenges by integrating causality with machine learning/AI to produce `reliable real-world evidence` and build `equitable clinical AI` models that benefit all patient populations.

## Join us
**Post-doc Fellows** We are looking for one [postdoctoral fellow](https://linyingzhang.com/files/Postdoc.pdf) to work on causal AI for health care.

**PhD Students** We are looking for 1-2 PhD students starting Fall 2026. Please apply directly to the [Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS)](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/programs/biomedical-informatics-data-science/) PhD program at Washington University School of Medicine. In your PhD application, please explicitly mention your interest in working with Professor Linying Zhang. Existing BIDS and Computational & Systems Biology (CSB) PhD students interested in rotating through the lab should email Dr. Zhang directly.

**Undergraduates or Master's Students** Undergraduates and Master's students looking for research opportunities are encouraged to apply through the [BIDS@I2 Summer Research Internship](https://i2db.wustl.edu/education-programs/bids-summer-internship/). We are looking for students who have taken at least one machine learning course and received a good grade. For masters students, we typically expect students to have taken a graduate-level machine learning course and a graduate-level probability or statistical inference course, or have had significant related research experience. WashU students interested in research assistantship should email Dr. Zhang directly.
