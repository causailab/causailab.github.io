Dr. [Linying Zhang](https://linyingzhang.com) is an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the [Institute for Informatics, Data Science and Biostatistics](https://i2db.wustl.edu) at [Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://medicine.wustl.edu) where she leads the `CausAI Lab` to integrate `causality` with `artificial intelligence (AI)` to achieve reliable real-world evidence (RWE) generation in clinical research and equitable clinical AI for all.

## Lab mission
AI holds tremendous potential to transform health care and improve patient outcomes if developed and applied thoughtfully. AI models are often trained on `real-world data (RWD)` in health care. RWD are  complex, messy, and reflect existing health disparities. To harness AI effectively, it is crucial to design methodologies that not only manage but also rectify the biases embedded within RWD. Our lab is dedicated to integrating the fields of causality and artificial intelligence to create more `reliable real-world evidence (RWE)` and develop `equitable clinical AI` models across all patient groups.

## Join us
**Post-doc Fellows** We are looking for one [postdoctoral fellow](https://linyingzhang.com/files/Postdoc.pdf) to work on causal AI for health care.

**PhD Students** We are looking for 1-2 PhD students starting Fall 2024. Please apply directly to the [Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS)](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/programs/biomedical-informatics-data-science/) PhD program at Washington University School of Medicine. In your PhD application, please explicitly mention your interest in working with Professor Linying Zhang. Existing BIDS and Computational & Systems Biology (CSB) PhD students interested in rotating through the lab should email Dr. Zhang directly.

**Undergraduates or Master's Students** Undergraduates and Master's students looking for research opportunities are encouraged to apply through the [BIDS@I2 Summer Research Internship](https://i2db.wustl.edu/education-programs/bids-summer-internship/). We are looking for students who have taken at least one machine learning course and received a good grade. For masters students, we typically expect students to have taken a graduate-level machine learning course and a graduate-level probability or statistical inference course, or have had significant related research experience. WashU students interested in research assistantship should email Dr. Zhang directly.
